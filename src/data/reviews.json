The place was clean, comfortable, and well maintained. The only thing to note is that it’s a bit far from the ghats, but apart from that, everything was excellent. Highly recommended!",

The kitchen was fully equipped, the bed very comfortable, and there were even some nice touches like snacks and coffee that made me feel right at home. Preeti was a fantastic host-super responsive, always available to answer any questions, and made sure everything was perfect throughout my stay. It's clear she puts a lot of care into her place, and it really shows in every little detail. Hands down, this has been one of the best Airbnb experiences. If you're thinking about staying here, don't think twice-you won't regret it! I'm already looking forward to booking this place again next time I'm in the area. Highly recommended!",

The ambiance was amazing, and I particularly enjoyed having access to the terrace.\n\nFor meals, they provide a menu with various food options you can order from. All major cultural and religious sites, including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, are within a 10-12 km radius. Pro tip: Instead of booking cabs, use shared autos from the main road - they're much more economical.\n\nSpecial mention to Mangal Bhaiya, who takes care of the property. He's among the most humble and helpful people I've ever met.\n\nI highly recommend this property for anyone visiting Banaras!",
